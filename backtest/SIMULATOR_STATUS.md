# AUREON offline simulator + boost redesign — status & findings

Branch: `claude/simulator-and-boost-v2`. This document is the **"report before
writing code"** deliverable required by the task, plus an honest record of what
is built, what is **blocked on data**, and exactly what is needed to finish.

---

## TL;DR

- **Part 1A (tick cache) — BUILT & TESTED** (`python bot.py fetchticks --from … --to …`).
- **Part 1B/1C (the simulator + reports) — BUILT, UNVALIDATED** (`python bot.py
  simulate --from … --to …`). The REAL `LiveTrader._tick()` loop drives a fake
  broker offline (no strategy fork); every artifact carries the mandatory
  **GATE-NOT-RUN** header.
- **THE GATE — CANNOT PASS YET.** It needs real 2026-07 ticks + the 200-position
  deal export. Neither is in the sandbox, so the gate is wired and run but reports
  **NOT PASSED** on synthetic data — never a fabricated pass, never tuned to match.
- **Part 2 (boost redesign) — NOT STARTED, by instruction** ("do not implement
  `boost_spec_v2` until the gate passes on real ticks"). `AUREON_boost_redesign_spec.md`
  is also not yet in the repo.
- Per the task's rule — *"if the baseline does not reproduce the MT5 truth, every
  downstream number is fiction … do not tune the sim to match … stop and report"*
  — Parts 2–3 are held until the gate passes on the committed real-tick cache.

## PRELIMINARY 1 — what `backtest/` models today

`backtest/backtest.py::run_month` is a **single-engine, M1-BAR** replay:

- `ticks_to_m1()` aggregates ticks → M1 OHLC and drives the live
  `strategy.update_position_on_bar` **on bars**. Intrabar order is a heuristic
  (both stops in one bar → `SELL if close>=open else BUY`; boost trigger scans
  `high` then `low`).
- **Modeled** (via real live modules — see `LIVE_RULE_SOURCES`): anchor placement,
  No-OCO straddle (first fill + sibling), trails/locks/ladder, the RALLY/RESCUE
  boost family via `boosts.plan_boost_event` + whipsaw cap, per-leg EOD flatten,
  and a crude **per-day realized** kill (`daily_pnl <= -daily_loss_pct*balance`).

### MISSING (bounds what any current result can prove)

| Feature | In `backtest/` today? |
|---|---|
| **Rogue** engine (`rogue.py`) | ❌ |
| **Fetcher** engine (`fetcher.py`) | ❌ |
| **F-B `trapped_late_rescue`** (`rescue.py`) | ❌ (only RALLY/RESCUE) |
| Per-engine **loss stops / profit locks / fail pause / entry caps** (`daystops.py`) | ❌ |
| **3% kill switch on equity incl. unrealized** (`risk._check_kill_switch`) | ❌ (only realized per-day) |
| **Friday weekend-hold ban** (D-6) | ❌ |
| Real **magics / `AUR_*` comments** → `pnl_report` classifier | ❌ (uses `Position` objects + its own CSV) |
| `daystops.py`, `risk.py` driven | ❌ |
| `break_hold` / `fp_guard` | imported, **not invoked** in `run_month` |

So today's backtest speaks only to **anchors**, on bars, with no governors — it
cannot address the trapped-leg/boost question at the heart of this task.

## PRELIMINARY 2 — tick availability (SAID LOUDLY)

`backtest/tick_fetcher.py` has a real MT5 path (`copy_ticks_range(…, COPY_TICKS_INFO)`)
**and** a synthetic fallback. **In this sandbox:** `import MetaTrader5` fails
(Windows-only) → the fetch returns `None`; `backtest/ticks/` holds only `.gitkeep`.
**Real 2026-07 ticks are NOT obtainable here.** The only data available is a
deterministic random walk around \$4300 (explicitly "illustrative"), which cannot
reproduce real market P&L. **A bar sim cannot resolve intrabar wick ORDER** — the
single ambiguity that decides whether a trapped leg's SL fires before the winner's
trail locks (~\$1,100 per the task's own note). The new manifest records tick-vs-M1
resolution per day so this is never hidden.

## PRELIMINARY 3 — offline constraints (confirmed)

The current backtest already runs MT5-disconnected, places no orders, and writes
only under `backtest/`. Part 1A preserves this: `fetchticks` reads MT5 for history
ticks only and writes **only** under `backtest/ticks/` (asserted by selftest 297).

---

## BUILT — Part 1A: per-day tick cache + manifest

`backtest/tick_cache.py` + `python bot.py fetchticks --from D1 --to D2 [--force]`:

- One file per calendar day: `backtest/ticks/XAUUSD_YYYY-MM-DD.parquet` (CSV
  fallback when pyarrow is absent). **Idempotent** — a day on disk is not refetched
  unless `--force`; its resolution is preserved.
- `backtest/ticks/manifest.json` records, per day: **resolution actually obtained**
  (`tick` / `M1` / `unavailable`), row count, source, path, fetched-at.
- Real fetch tries **ticks first**, falls back to **M1 bars** (flagged, because
  intrabar order is then unknown), and reports **`unavailable`** (writing nothing)
  when MT5 is absent — honest, never fabricated.
- **selftest 297** proves the plumbing (per-day split, idempotency, resolution
  tagging, M1 flag, unavailable-writes-no-file, tz-aware round-trip, writes scoped
  to `backtest/ticks/`, MT5 read degrades cleanly) with an injected synthetic
  day-fetch — no MT5 needed.

Selftest total: **297 steps** (was 296; +1 = step 297 "sim tick cache").

## BLOCKED — and exactly what unblocks each

### THE GATE (Part 1B/1C validation)
Needs: **(a)** real ticks for 2026-07-01..07-10 — run `python bot.py fetchticks
--from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-10` **on the VPS** (live MT5), commit
`backtest/ticks/*.parquet` + `manifest.json`; **(b)** the **200-position deal
export** (comment-labelled) that produced the MT5 truth table, so the sim's
per-anchor / rogue / fetcher output can be diffed against it to a stated tolerance.

### Part 1B/1C — the simulator + reports (BUILT, unvalidated)
`backtest/sim_broker.py` (fake broker) + `backtest/simulator.py` (driver) +
`backtest/sim_report.py` (reports) + `backtest/sim_gate.py` (the gate). Run:
`python bot.py simulate --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-10`.

- **No strategy fork.** A `FakeMT5` handle simulates the broker at TICK
  resolution; the **real `mt5_adapter.MT5Adapter`** is wrapped around it (its
  order/reconcile/price logic reused verbatim). `LiveTrader` is constructed
  `paper=False` (paper mode disables the fill-reconcile + boost engine), so the
  **real** order path, fills reconcile, trails, rogue, fetcher, boost family,
  every `daystops` governor, the 3% kill switch (`risk._check_kill_switch`, on
  equity **incl. unrealized**), and the EOD/Friday flatten all run against the
  fake broker. Verified in-sim: anchor stops fill on tick touch, positions close
  at TP/SL, OUT deals carry **real magics + `AUR_*` comments** (so
  `pnl_report.classify_comment` + `pnl_source.magic_day_net` work unchanged), and
  the anchors day-profit-stop governor fires.
- **Clock:** `pandas.Timestamp.now` is monkeypatched to the sim tick time for the
  run (the tick loop reads wall-clock `now()`, not the tick); the fake adapter's
  `server_time_utc()` returns the same sim time.
- **Isolation:** all engine-state writes go to a scratch dir via `AUREON_RUN_DIR`;
  **nothing** is written under the live `run/` (asserted by selftest 298, which
  snapshots `run/` before/after). Reports go to `sim/reports/<run-id>/`.
- **Every artifact** (daily `.md`, `pnl_ledger.csv`, `summary.md`, `GATE.txt`,
  console) carries the two-line **GATE-NOT-RUN** header. Removed only when the
  gate passes.
- **What it still cannot model / caveats:** intrabar order on any non-`tick` day
  (M1/synthetic) is unknown — the manifest flags it and the gate **hard-refuses**;
  spread/slippage are configurable approximations (defaults 0.20 / 0.0); the sim
  has not been validated against real July prices (synthetic ticks only here).
- **Hardening (07-10, owner spec §3/§4 + confirms; see `BOOST_REDESIGN_TZ_NOTES.md`):**
  (a) the sim replays the **cached ticks verbatim** and **REFUSES M1 days** — it
  never interpolates invented intrabar prices; (b) every emitted leg's comment
  **must classify** as `AUR_*` — a non-classifying comment is a **BUILD ERROR**,
  never a phantom `??`/`ext` bucket; (c) the gate **HARD-REFUSES** (no verdict) on
  any non-tick day or build error, rather than warning; (d) the injected clock
  drives the **broker-day roll** (governor resets), asserted by selftest 298
  (`last_broker_date` == sim day, not the wall clock).

### Part 2 — boost redesign (`boost_spec_v2`, default OFF)
Gated on the GATE passing **and** on `AUREON_boost_redesign_spec.md` (not in repo).
The R1–R8 summary is captured in the task; the `tstop`-with-`freeze=0` decision
(add `tstop_after_min` vs disable) and the F-B gating are ready to implement once
the sim can validate them. Not started (task: "do not build (2) before (1)
validates").

### Part 3 — variant runs (baseline / freeze=0 / boost_v2 / combined / +sl_dist 20)
Entirely data-bound (trapped-leg survival vs a \$20 stop, R7 fire count, 07-03
outlier). Blocked until 1B runs on real ticks.

## Recommended next step

The machinery is built. To make it MEAN anything, on the VPS:
```
python bot.py fetchticks --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-10   # real ticks
git add backtest/ticks && git commit                          # commit the cache
# commit the 200-position deal export CSV under backtest/ (name it deal_export*.csv)
python bot.py simulate  --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-10     # run the gate for real
```
Then the gate compares sim buckets to the deal-export truth on all-tick data. If
it PASSES to tolerance, the GATE-NOT-RUN header is removed and Part 2
(`boost_spec_v2`) begins. If it does not, the gap is REPORTED and explained —
never tuned away.
